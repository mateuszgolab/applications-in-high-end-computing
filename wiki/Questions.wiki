= Question/Assumptions (to ask Stuart) =

<MAJOR>

 * 1 Is established network connection a user non-functional requirement or shall we ignore it?

 * 3 Shall we treat Recovery Manager as a actor?

<MINOR>

 * 1 Shall we paralelise workflow? How can we paralelize otherwise?
 * 2 Scientist can abort simulation during execution?


 * Dispatcher is a requirement?
 * We should mention that there is a possibility to use translator, but it is a simple module too (maybe just in the dictionary can be enough)
