#summary List of Question.

= Question/Assumptions (to ask Stuart) =

<MAJOR>

 * 1 Is established network connection a user non-functional requirement or shall we ignore it?
 * 2 Many users have possibility to connect to system simultaneously. But there is only one running program at time (users requests' go to queue - serial workflow) <<<FUNCTIONAL OR NOT>>>. 
 * 3 Shall we treat Recovery Manager as a actor?
 * 4 Dispatcher is a requirement?
 * 5 Are all infos contained in slides requirements or some of them are just suggestions how to resolve problems

<MINOR>

 * 1 Shall we paralelise workflow? How can we paralelize otherwise?
 * 2 Scientist can abort simulation during execution?
 * 3 We should mention that there is a possibility to use translator, but it is a simple module too (maybe just in the dictionary can be enough)
