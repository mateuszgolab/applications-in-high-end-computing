#summary List of assumptions.

= Controversial Assumptions (to ask Stuart) =

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS

 * 1* Parallel access to recources through program (supercomputers, grids) - many users in the same time.
 * 2* Input and output are standarized. (Otherwise there would have to be translators between modules when in/out change - who would create translators?)
 * 3* Admin can, not only replace but also add/remove modules from workflow.
 * 4* Nature of optimizer we have to run all modules (mesh, solver) before each iteration of optimising.



DETAIL ASSUMPTIONS

 * 1* XML Descriptor - should be hardcored


= Confirmed Assumptions =

* 1 System is specified to resolve particular problem (wing-shape optimization). It is not general solution for all workflows in the world.
* 2
