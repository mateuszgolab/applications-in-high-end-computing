#summary List of assumptions.

= Controversial Assumptions (to ask Stuart) =

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS

 * 1* Parallel access to recources through clients(supercomputers, grids) - many users in the same time. YESSSS
 * 2* Input and output are standarized. (Otherwise there would have to be translators between modules when in/out change - who would create translators?)
 * 3* There will be only one translator between two modules (if such a thing exists in system [translator]).
 * 4* Admin can, only replace not add/remove modules from workflow.
 * 5* Nature of optimizer:
    * a)* what changes Shape Parameters in each new iteration (not first one)
    * b)* is this separate module, what happens when solver finishes? 
    * c)* we have to run all modules (mesh, solver) before each iteration of optimising. 
 * 6* Shall we paralelise workflow? How can we paralelize otherwise?
 * 7* Solver's output does not have to be scalar value - can be vector matrix, so that there is no fixed comparer.
 * 8* One iteration last minutes (or hours or days or years). Information needed for recovery system.
 * 9* Dispatcher as a main program controller?



DETAIL ASSUMPTIONS

 * 1* XML Descriptor - should be hardcored


= Confirmed Assumptions =

* 1 System is specified to resolve particular problem (wing-shape optimization). It is not general solution for all workflows in the world.
* 2
