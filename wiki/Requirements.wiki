#summary Requirements for the Workflow program
#labels Phase-Requirements



= Functional Requirements =

  * 1 Recovery system: possibility of restarting workflow when system crushes.
  * 2 XML Descriptor: Define a descriptor file (XML) to describe each step of the workflow
    * 2.1 Descriptor should descript the instructions and parameters for each module
    * 2.2 The user should be able to change any components in the workflow without affecting other parts of the system
  * 3 Simultaneous access to system: many users should have access to system recources.
  * 4 Possibility of exchange the individual modules
  * 5 Monitoring of errors: Users can see the exact location of failures.
      
= Non-functional Requirements =

   * 1 Validation: take care of input/output formats of specific modules.
   * 2 Create universal communication standards: communications protocols etc.
   * 3 Parallelization in optimistaion part (it's important especially when we execute algorithms given nondeterministic output)
