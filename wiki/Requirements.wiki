#summary Requirements for the Workflow program
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Functional Requirements =

  * 1 Recovery system: possibility of restarting workflow when system crushes.
     * a Monitoring of errors: Users can see the exact location of failures.
     * b Flexible recovery policy (depending on expected time of execution we decide to store data before/after module or after each iteration) 
  * 2 (FUNCTIONAL or NON??) Many users have possibility to connect to system simultaneously. But there is only one running program at time (users requests' go to queue - serial workflow).
  * 3 User can add/remove arbitrary number of modules into workflow.
  * 4 User can run simulation with uploaded parameters.


= Non-functional Requirements =

   * 1 Validation: take care of input/output formats of specific modules.
   * 2 Create universal/independent communication standards between modules
   * 3 Descriptor files would be XML.
   * 4 Modules can run on many different remote systems using different platforms but hey have to be already installed.
   * 5 Network connection between terminal, workload server and remote systems are established.
